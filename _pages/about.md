I am a Graduate Research Assistant at Florida State University working under the supervision of Professors Richard Bertram and Theodore Vo (Monash University). I possess expertise in the formal and computational analysis of multi-timescale dynamical systems, including formal dimension-reduction and the numerical computation of low-dimensional invariant manifolds.
