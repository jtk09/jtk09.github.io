I am a Graduate Research Assistant in Applied Mathematics at Florida State University working under the supervision of Professors Richard Bertram and Theodore Vo (Monash University). I possess expertise in the formal and computational analysis of multi-timescale dynamical systems, including geometric methods for reduced-order approximation and numerical methods for computing the low-dimensional geometric structures which organize solution behavior. Such techniquees often provide the most visually intuitive low-dimensional subspaces within which complex nonlinear solution behavior can be explained and predicted.

I am passionate about developing and applying computational approaches to problems in both science and real-world applications with a growing interest in the intersection between dynamical systems and data science/machine learning. Through my research experiences and winding path of advanced coursework in mathematics and statistics, I have developed skills in the use of Python, MATLAB, R, Mathematica, C, Fortran, Git, AUTO, XPP, and Linux.
