I am a Graduate Research Assistant at Florida State University working under the supervision of Professors Richard Bertram and Theodore Vo (Monash University). I possess expertise in the formal and computational analysis of multi-timescale dynamical systems, including formal dimension-reduction and the numerical computation of low-dimensional invariant manifolds.

I am passionate about developing and applying computational approaches to problems in both science and real-world applications with a growing interest in the intersection between dyanmical systems and data science/machine learning. Through my research experiences and winding path of coursework, I have developed skills in the use of Python, MATLAB, Mathematica, C, Fortran, Git, AUTO, XPP, and Linux.
